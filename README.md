# Quantum Tic Tac Toe

The non-deterministic version of Tic Tac Toe, where you make two entangled quantum moves each turn that eventually collapse into a classical move. [Try it out](http://qttt.rohanp.xyz)

## Tech

Build with React, Node, and Socket.io.

Currently the server is not up and running but you can still play the static version!

See [release](https://github.com/rohanp/QuantumTicTacToe/releases/) for more details/progress on polishing and deploying the app.
